I'm **Effie** and this is my space. I post texts I wrote in an attempt to understand things + organise my thoughts ❤️

I studied Genetics following a childhood intense interest in genetic engineering, provoked by this [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6394363-genes-dna). After working on projects ranging from yeast molecular genetics and structural biology to evolutionary genetics/mathematical modelling and data science/computing, I started my PhD at the University of Edinburgh. I am investigating the initiating factors of the intial responce of vascular smooth muscle cells to injury and evaluate RNA therapeutic candidates + viral vector delivery for vein graft failure.

I am interested in biology, genetics, futurism, techno-optimism, techno-capitalism and space *✧･ﾟ: *✧･ﾟ:
